# Analysts-Travelling-Salesman

The Analyst’s Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP) is a variation of the classic
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that emerges in the realm of geometric mea-
sure theory and analysis. Unlike the traditional TSP, which deals with a finite
collection of points (cities), the ATSP considers arbitrary subsets of Euclidean
space.

The core question in the ATSP is: given a set of points in Euclidean space, can
we find a curve of finite length (a rectifiable curve) that visits all the points? While
the traditional TSP focuses on the shortest possible route, the ATSP delves into
the fundamental question of whether such a curve exists at all.

# Key differences between the TSP and ATSP
• Finite vs. infinite: TSP deals with finite sets of points, while ATSP involves
potentially infinite sets.
• Shortest route vs. existence: TSP seeks the shortest route, whereas ATSP
focuses on the existence of a rectifiable curve passing through the set.
The ATSP has significant implications in various fields, including geometric anal-
ysis, computational geometry, and optimization theory. It offers a deeper under-
standing of the geometric properties of sets and the complexity of covering them
with curves of finite length.

History of the ATSP
The ATSP was solved in 1990 by Jones [1]. In this paper, Jones completely re-
solves the question posed by the ATSP: the result gives not only sufficient condi-
tions for when a set in the plane is rectifiable, but also necessary conditions. Even
more, Jones’ work gives a rectifiable curve whose length is a constant multiple of
the length of the curve of optimal length passing through the set. In 1992, Okikiolu
extended Peter Jones’ work to all Euclidean spaces [2]. Fifteen years later, Schul
extended the work of Jones and Okikiolu to the setting of Hilbert spaces.
